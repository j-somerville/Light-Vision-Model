# Light-Vision-Model
Model for target and bycatch species to determine how they might view light underwater
R script, code, CSV and Excel files for the vision model, which predicts how target and bycatch species may view light underwater. The CSV files are those needed to input into the Rscript: Quantum catch bycatch_target model. The excel file (Bycatch target and vision data) is a spreadsheet of how vision data was obtained from the literature, with references for each study and paper.
Irradiance data was extracted and obtained from Sticklus et al (2018): https://doi.org/10.3390/s18113710
LED radiances were measured in dark conditions from a distance of 50 cm in air, using spectroradiometer JETI specbos 1211-2. LEDs were provided by SafetyNet Technologies (https://sntech.co.uk/)
